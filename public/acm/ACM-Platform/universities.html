				<h1 class="clear">ACM for Universities</h1>
				<img src="../images/platform/2.jpg" alt="" />
				<p>ACM is all about using the best of search engine techniques. Search is already integral to our lives, so ACM seeks to apply these techniques in a way that can help us analyse how to pursue that dream job better.</p>
				<h2>Hard to keep the curriculum relevant? Difficult to assist students in achieving the competencies required for their desired jobs?</h2>
				<p>Schools declare a list of competencies to be attained by the students upon completion for each course offered. For institutions, the sheer numbers of courses means that it is a massive undertaking to evaluate how and where courses are relevant to industry, let alone understanding what each job requires. 
				</br></br>
				For students, it is immensely menial to track what skills are relevant, let alone planning for the experiences needed to acquire these skills.</p>
				</br>
				<h2>Why ACM?</h2>
				<h3>Universities</h3>
				<p>ACM  utilises an algorithm that matches job descriptions and course competencies to skillsets. With data regarding job requirements collected from across industries, schools can compare the courses they offer with the skills most relevant and sought after by employers across industries.
 				</br></br>
				ACM facilitates educational institutions in identifying gaps between the skills individual courses impart with what the industry is seeking. With ACM, institutions can better cater their teaching materials to what is relevant at any point of time as opposed to relying on statistics like employment rate to evaluate the efficiency of a course.
				</p>
				<h3>Students</h3>
				<p>
				Students can map their competences of completed courses any point of time during the course of their studies, and can visualise the gaps between a desired job role in a particular company. With such visualisation, students may even be able to better select courses that might be more beneficial to them, or apply for external training courses to narrow the gaps before graduation.
